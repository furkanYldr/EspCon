## About the Project

This project aims to bring a portable gaming experience powered by the **ESP32** microcontroller. The console is built using custom hardware and software solutions designed to run retro-style games. The project merges modern technology with nostalgic gaming, creating a low-cost, compact, and portable gaming device.

## Features

An open-source platform for casual and retro games powered by the ESP32-S3. The projectâ€™s goal is to create a device that offers a fast, short, and enjoyable gaming experience, perfect for one-handed use. Ideal for playing during commutes, while waiting in line, or sipping coffee. The device includes a 1.9-inch screen, 4-directional buttons, 3 function buttons, and a scroll that acts as a trigger when held sideways, allowing easy navigation between menus and enhancing the gaming experience (for example, in the ColorCode game).

This platform focuses on re-creations of retro games, made without any game engineâ€”just C++ and an additional graphics library. In the future, I plan to create a game engine where scene management can be done with simple code, using the mechanics collected from these games. If you're interested in contributing or collaborating, feel free to reach out!
### Device

## Setup

### Required Software

- **Arduino IDE**: I recommend using the Arduino IDE to program the ESP32.
- **ESP32 Board Support**: Follow the [ESP32 Arduino Setup Guide](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) to add ESP32 board support to the Arduino IDE.

### Connection and Upload


I will share the circuit diagram after creating an optimal solution. Currently, I am using the LilyGO T-Display S3 in the device. I am testing different setups by combining separate boards, screens, and chips. Once I resolve the issues, I will share the final version along with a suitable shell as an STL file for 3dprint .
For now, you need to check the pin connections in the game code for each game individually to test them. Stay tuned! ðŸš€

## Usage

The console features a simple menu with several retro games. Use the buttons to select and play the games. The console will provide basic instructions at the start of each game.
