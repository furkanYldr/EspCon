# Standalone Handheld Game Console (ESP32)

This project is the design and development of a standalone game console running on the **ESP32** platform. Retro games are reverse-engineered and transferred to the platform without using any game engine. The goal is to improve game mechanics creation and algorithm analysis.

## About the Project

This project aims to bring a portable gaming experience powered by the **ESP32** microcontroller. The console is built using custom hardware and software solutions designed to run retro-style games. The project merges modern technology with nostalgic gaming, creating a low-cost, compact, and portable gaming device.

## Features

- **ESP32-Based Game Console**: A powerful platform in a small form factor.
- **Retro Game Support**: Retro games have been reverse-engineered and ported.
- **Standalone Operation**: No game engine is used; the software runs directly on the hardware.
- **Portable Design**: A handheld, easy-to-carry game console.

## Setup

### Required Software

- **Arduino IDE**: We recommend using the Arduino IDE to program the ESP32.
- **ESP32 Board Support**: Follow the [ESP32 Arduino Setup Guide](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) to add ESP32 board support to the Arduino IDE.

### Connection and Upload

1. **Connect Your ESP32**: Use a USB cable to connect the ESP32 device to your computer.
2. **Open Arduino IDE**: Select the appropriate ESP32 board in the IDE.
3. **Upload the Code**: Upload the main files from this repository to your ESP32.

## Usage

The console features a simple menu with several retro games. Use the buttons to select and play the games. The console will provide basic instructions at the start of each game.

### Games

- **Tetris**: A challenging yet fun classic.
- **Snake**: The timeless favorite.
- **Pong**: A simple and fun two-player game.

More games are being added!
