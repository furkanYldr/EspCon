# Standalone Handheld Game Console (ESP32)

This project is the design and development of a standalone game console running on the **ESP32** platform. Retro games are reverse-engineered and transferred to the platform without using any game engine. The goal is to improve game mechanics creation and algorithm analysis.

## About the Project

This project aims to bring a portable gaming experience powered by the **ESP32** microcontroller. The console is built using custom hardware and software solutions designed to run retro-style games. The project merges modern technology with nostalgic gaming, creating a low-cost, compact, and portable gaming device.

## Features

An open-source platform for casual and retro games powered by ESP32-S3. The projectâ€™s goal is to offer a one-handed gaming experience with fast, short gameplay sessions. It's designed for moments like waiting in line while sipping your coffeeâ€”play with one hand, then tuck it in your pocket. The device features a 1.9-inch screen, a 4-way directional pad, 3 function buttons, and a scroll wheel. When the device is held sideways, the scroll wheel acts like a trigger button, allowing you to navigate between menus and enhance the gaming experience through related game mechanics (you can check ColorCode for an example).

The platform includes faithful re-creations of retro games. No game engine is used; games are developed purely in C++ with an additional graphics library (in the future, I plan to create a game engine where simple coding and mechanics can be used to manage scenes and develop games; feel free to reach out if you want to participate or help).

## Setup

### Required Software

- **Arduino IDE**: I recommend using the Arduino IDE to program the ESP32.
- **ESP32 Board Support**: Follow the [ESP32 Arduino Setup Guide](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) to add ESP32 board support to the Arduino IDE.

### Connection and Upload


I will share the circuit diagram after creating an optimal solution. Currently, I am using the LilyGO T-Display S3 in the device. I am testing different setups by combining separate boards, screens, and chips. Once I resolve the issues, I will share the final version along with a suitable shell as an STL file for 3dprint .

For now, you need to check the pin connections in the game code for each game individually to test them. Stay tuned! ðŸš€

## Usage

The console features a simple menu with several retro games. Use the buttons to select and play the games. The console will provide basic instructions at the start of each game.
